# COVID-BIM-V2

The CSV files are too large to upload on github, if you need to run this project please email Dr. Vinu Subashini Rajus at vinu.rajus@carleton.ca

## Getting Started

###### Clone the repository

###### Get dependencies

```npm install```

```npm i -S fast-csv```

```npm install csv-split-stream```

###### Make a Forge Account

[Autodesk Forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/)

###### Use Forge Credentials to Run the Application

See ```launch.json``` in the ```.vscode``` folder. Enter your client ID and secret there. 

###### Convert Simulation Results to CSV

Place your ```state.txt``` file into the ```scripts``` folder, then cd into the ```scripts``` folder and run the following command in terminal: 

```cat state.txt | python state_txt_to_csv-VCP.py```

This will output ```state_change.csv```

###### Create Folder(s) for Simulation Data

Create a folder in ```public``` called ```data``` and store your ```state_change.csv``` there. Next, create a folder in the ```data``` folder called ```output```. This is where the split CSVs will be stored.

## Things to Watch out for

- The filepath of the CSV being read
- How the cells are counted based on time steps
- How long to spend reading each time step
  - Might need to skip a few files at a time 
- ```csvStreamer.js``` has ```req.setTimeout(0)``` for users with slow computers. Remove the timeout callback when running the application outside of localhost. 

## Plans for the Future

- Look into flags for WebGL errors
- Solve how to find max number of viral particles without slowing things down
- Save ```state_change.csv``` to ```public/data``` automatically after running Python script?
- Stop sprites / icons from changing size when zooming in or out
  - Could potentially be done through the size parameter in the shader
